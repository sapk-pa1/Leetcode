Problem statement: 
1. Merging two string str1 and str2 
2. sometimes the str1 or the str2 will be greater so the remaining string is appended to the end without making 
comparision 


Example 

word1 = a b 
word 2 = p q r s 

merged = a p b q r s -> since there is only a and b remaininig 2 of the word2 is merged as it is without 
making a comparision

Possible solutions(Mine ): 

1. one linear search through the smallest string one 
2. append the remaining char from the largest string 


Data Structure to be used: 
List <- To append the char
String <- To convert into the final merged string
